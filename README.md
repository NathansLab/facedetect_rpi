# facedetect_rpi

A collection of my scripts for face detection and procesing. 

Among them my main project: a multitasking python script recognizing faces on a Raspberry Pi

I am trying to build a face detection system wich notifies people via Slack messages, if a certain person was seen on camera. 
The idea is that it runs in a makerspace with a camera above the door in order to tell all the makerspace members who is currently in the lab and who left.
Cool features like TTS and LED effects are planned for futre versions.
